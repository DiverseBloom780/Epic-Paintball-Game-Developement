# Paintball (Integrated Pygame Example)

A single, clean Pygame project that integrates:
- Player movement & shooting
- Enemy bots with simple chase & shoot AI
- Teams (Red vs Blue), scoring, respawn system
- Field obstacles and bullet collision
- Paintball gun with ammo & reload
- Simple team communication bus (console print + on-screen log)
- Game modes scaffold (Elimination as the default)
- A minimal HUD

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Controls:** WASD to move, mouse to aim, left-click to shoot, R to reload, ESC to quit.
